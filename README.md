## About The Project

**"Will you go out with me on Valentine‚Äôs Day?"**  

Features include:  
- A pixel-style envelope that opens smoothly with animation  
- Two options: **Yes** and **No**  
- The **No** button playfully dodges the cursor as you try to click it  
- Clicking **Yes** triggers a cheerful confetti celebration and reveals details of the date, time, and venue

Perfect for surprising a special someone or showcasing pixel art animation skills!
